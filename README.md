# Space Age
### A website created to calculate age in various ways
### **By Tyler Bussanich**

## Description

This is a website designed to give the user various outputs for their age. The user is able to determine how many seconds old they are by entering their age or their date of birth. The user is also able to see what their age is on a few different planets.

## Setup/Installation

Open the terminal on your computer.

Navigate to your desktop.

Enter "git clone https://github.com/tbssnch/space-age.git"

Enter atom . (or whichever text editor you prefer)

In the dist file, open index.html in the browser of your choice.

## Feedback

This was a pretty intense project! In the future, I would add a function that would generate the users life expectancy on each planet. I would also add a function so the user can see their age in months, days, and minutes.
